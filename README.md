# FujiTech-students_app

This repository contains an app made by FujiTech students participating in a mentoring program.

üöÄ The purpose of this repository is to showcase the group work of students participating in mentoring sessions, where they develop a complete application (frontend and backend). The application development is conducted under the guidance of a mentor, who is responsible for code review and organizing the workflow using the Scrum methodology (acting as the Scrum Master).

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech stack:

- Vue 3
- TypeScript
- FastAPI
- Vitest, Playwright, and Pytest

## üë®‚Äçüíª Methodology:

Scrum, 2-week sprints

## üê≥ Running the project with Docker

### 1. Prerequisites

- Install Docker Desktop before proceeding: [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

### 2. Running the entire project with Docker

To build and run both frontend and backend services, use:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

If you want to force a clean rebuild without cache, use:

```bash
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up
```

To stop the containers, run:

```bash
docker compose down
```

To remove images and volumes after stopping, run:

```bash
docker compose down --rmi all --volumes
```

### 3. Running a single service with Docker

#### Running only the backend:

```bash
docker compose up --build backend
```

To restart only the backend container:

```bash
docker compose restart backend
```

#### Running only the frontend:

```bash
docker compose up --build frontend
```

To restart only the frontend container:

```bash
docker compose restart frontend
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Running the project natively (without Docker)

### 1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo-url
cd FujiTech-students_app
```

### 2. Install dependencies:

#### Install backend dependencies and activate the virtual environment:

For pip users:

```bash
python3 -m venv backend/.venv
source backend/.venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: backend\.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install backend/
```

For uv users:

```bash
uv sync --project backend
source backend/.venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: backend\.venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### Install frontend dependencies (using pnpm):

```bash
pnpm --dir frontend install
```

### 3. Run the services:

#### Run backend:

You can run the backend using FastAPI:

```bash
fastapi dev backend/main.py
```

Or directly with Uvicorn:

```bash
uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
```

#### Run frontend:

```bash
pnpm --dir frontend dev
```

## üì° API Communication

The frontend communicates directly with the backend using a custom composable that wraps Nuxt‚Äôs `useFetch()`. This composable handles API requests without relying on a proxy, sending requests directly to the backend endpoints.

**Important:** The backend must be running before starting the frontend to ensure proper API communication.

---

## Useful Docker Commands

List running containers:

```bash
docker ps
```

Check container logs (replace `container_name` with the actual name):

```bash
docker logs -f container_name
```

Access a running container:

```bash
docker exec -it container_name sh
```

Prune unused images, containers, and networks:

```bash
docker system prune -a
```

## Additional Notes on Docker Build and Volumes

During the Docker image build process, your Dockerfile copies your source code and installs dependencies. This creates a "snapshot" of your application, including a properly installed `node_modules` folder (for frontend) and backend dependencies.

In a development environment, `docker-compose` mounts your local source code (e.g., `./frontend`) into the container. This allows for live updates (hot reload) when you change your code. However, mounting the entire folder from your host overwrites the content of the container ‚Äì including the `node_modules` folder ‚Äì if it exists on the host.

To prevent this, an anonymous volume is mounted for the `node_modules` folder (e.g., `- /app/frontend/node_modules`). This ensures that the dependencies installed during the image build are preserved, while the rest of your code remains synced with your host.

The `.dockerignore` file is used during the image build process to exclude unnecessary files (like your local `node_modules`) from being copied into the image. However, it does not affect what is mounted later as a volume by `docker-compose`.

This README provides instructions for running the project both in a Dockerized environment and natively, along with useful Docker commands and explanations of how build caching and volumes work.

Happy coding!
